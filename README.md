just click/tap the text

1. camera: make video source is from camera
2. src: is make the video is from file you pick from your computer or phone, *im not using your video, this asciivideo is working offline after the page is loaded*
3. width: letter length to be applied for asciivideo, if you put 100 so it will be 100 letters, and the height is automatic following video scale
4. color1: add color to the text using this metode 1 is fastes coloring letters, but you will find the wrong thing later
5. color2: there is no something wrong but lagg, but you can try change the *width* less than 50 but you cant see the image
6. theme: we have 2 themes, night and light, night is black background with white text, and light is the ememy of people who like coding, white background make the eyes burning,and the text is black
7. edge: is image post processing that will detect edge from video/camera
8. bloom: make text shadow so it looks like bold text
9. char kind: there is 3 type of text that will be used as grayscale colors, but my favourite is number one, click or tap the number to change
10. paused/played: tap this to play or pause the video

this is sample output, you can tap it to play or pause the video.
